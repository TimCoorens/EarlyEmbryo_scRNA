This repository contains the code used for the analysis of the single-cell RNA sequencing data of early embryos, used in the paper 'Identification of the Anterior Hypoblast and Signalling Interactions Driving Morphogenesis of the Human Embryo'.
For any queries, please email tc16@sanger.ac.uk.

The analysis of scRNAseq data in these scripts relies on Seurat (https://satijalab.org/seurat/).
